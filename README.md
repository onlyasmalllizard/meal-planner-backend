| ------- | --------------- |
| message | string          |
| success | boolean         |

The payload key will only be present on successful requests. More detailed information about its data type and structure will be found in the specific route information.

## Database Structure

![How the different database tables link together. In Households, the field Occupants refers to the Id field of the Users table. In Users, the Household field refers to the Id field of the Households table. Both the Organiser and the Attendees fields in the Plans table refer to the Id Field in the Users table.](./databaseStructure.drawio.svg)
